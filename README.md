# Automatic-Object-Border-Detection
# Overview
This project aims to automate the process of detecting object borders in images using computer vision techniques. The system uses edge detection algorithms to detect the borders of objects in an image and then draws a border around them. This project can be useful for image processing tasks such as object recognition, object tracking, and image segmentation.

# Features
Detects object borders in images automatically

Can handle multiple objects in an image

Uses edge detection algorithms for accurate border detection

Outputs the image with the detected borders as a separate file

Easy to use and can be customized based on the user's needs

# Technologies Used
OpenCV: for image processing

Python: for the programming language

NumPy: for data manipulation and analysis

Canny edge detection algorithm: for detecting edges in images

# How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine

Install the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file

Place the image file you want to process in the project folder

Modify the filename in the code to match the name of your image file

Run the automatic_object_border_detection.py file

The system will detect the object borders and output the image with the borders as a separate file in the project folder

# Future Improvements
Implement a GUI for ease of use

Use deep learning models for better object recognition accuracy

Add a feature to process multiple images at once
